# TigerBeetle Hackathon at Interledger Summit 2023

We're excited to announce our first hackathon! It's a one-day event that will take place during the [Interledger Summit](https://interledger.org/summit) on Wednesday, 8 November 2023.

## How to participate

You can get together with colleagues or individually, **in person** or **remotely**, to deliver a small project.

### 1. Choose one of the three challenges you're most excited about:

- **Safety Beetle:** Using a cluster of TigerBeetles to improve durability and availability.

    <table><tr valign="top">
    <td width="100"><img src="assets/safety.gif" align="left" margin ="16px" size="200px"/></td>
    <td>
    <b>Example:</b> Run multiple TigerBeetles and measure the availability when one or more replicas crash or are partitioned from the network. You can run it in the cloud or on your own laptop using anything you want (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes, etc). For a little more fun, you can even run TigerBeetle in a cluster of RaspberryPi's!
    </td>
    </tr></table>

- **Performance Beetle:** Using TigerBeetle to improve throughput and latency.

    <table><tr valign="top">
    <td width="100"><img src="assets/performance.gif" margin ="16px"/></td>
    <td>
    <b>Example:</b> Showcase how to achieve low latency and high throughput by creating a simple application using TigerBeetle. Chef's kiss if you use TigerBeetle with any <i>OLGP</i> (online general-purpose processing) database. It can be a relational database, NoSQL, in memory, or whatever you can think of!
    </td>
    </tr></table>

- **Experience Beetle:** Modeling application data using TigerBeetle double-entry accounts.

    <table><tr valign="top">
    <td width="100"><img src="assets/experience.gif" align="left" margin ="16px"/></td>
    <td>
    <b>Example:</b> Use TigerBeetle's double-entry account schema to solve common business problems that would require too much boilerplate code to implement with general-purpose databases, such as financial transfers, inventory movements, or just counting things There's no limit to your creativity!
    </td>
    </tr></table>


### 2. Create a proof of concept demonstrating what you just hacked using TigerBeetle:

No matter your background, you can participate in different ways.

Examples:

- Write a simple application or adapt an existing one using any programming language and tools of your choice, including other databases.

- Create infrastructure as code, manifests or scripts to manage TigerBeetle instances running on any supported platform.

- Use diagrams, charts, and writings to make your point.

### 3. Present your work:

Submit a pull request to this repository including all source code and artifacts you produced. Remember to describe your project and identify yourself and your teammates.

Present a short demo (10 minutes max) of your work **in-person** if you're attending the Interledger Summit 2023, or **send a recorded video** if you're not in Costa Rica ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡·!

## Prizes:

### First place:
[Steam Deck 64GB](https://www.steamdeck.com/hardware) all-in-one portable PC gamming. 

### Second place:
[Raspberry Pi 400](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/) personal computer kit.

### Third place:
Ticket for [Systems Distributed 2024](https://systemsdistributed.com/) and TigerBeetle swag.


## Evaluation criteria:

- All projects must be submitted by **November 8th, 2023 03:00 PM CST (GMT-6)**.

- All participants consent to the public release of their personal images and videos produced during the presentation.

- The TigerBeetle team, at their discretion, will award projects based on technical and subjective criteria such as creativity and innovation.

- The prizes can be handed over **in person** at the Interledger Summit 2023 or **shipped worldwide** for remote participants.

- In case of teams, they must assign one person to represent the project and receive the prize.
